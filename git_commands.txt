* git config --global user.username "ysj"
* git config --global user.email "yogendersingh@gmail.com"


1. To check if your local repository is connected to any remote repository
  git remote -v 


2. To add remote branch using git remote command syntax 
  git remote add name https://url.git 

  By convention we call this remote branch as the origin branch or origin in short.
  therefore - git remote add origin https://url.git
  
  * replace the .git url from the github hosted repository url


3. To rename or remove remote branch :
  git remote rename old_name new_name
  git remote remove name 


* Once we've connected to our remote branch on Github, we can push our code to the remote branch 


4. We tell git to push to the remote main/master branch called origin with the command:
  git push -u origin main/master

    * Basically we use -u flag when you want to set origin as the default upstream remote for a branch . 
      This is needed if you don't want to manually specify the remote every time you use git pull.  

  * Github has officialy changed naming convention of its master branch to main branch.
  * You'll see this reflected in the instructions that GitHub provides : 
    git branch -M main  // this is to rename the Master branch to main in git.
